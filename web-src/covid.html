				<strong>At  HKBeauty salon we confirm we have complied with the government’s guidance on managing the risk of COVID- 19. </strong>	
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have carried out a COVID – 19 Risk Assessment and shared the results with people who work here</li>
				<li>We have cleaning, handwashing and hygiene procedures in line with guidance</li>
				<li>We have taken all reasonable steps to maintain a 2m distance in the workplace</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of both our guests and team members it has been necessary to put a number of restrictions and safety measures in place for our hair and beauty services. This page will be updated as and when new information becomes available from the government. <br><br><strong>What we will do to protect you:</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A face mask to be worn at all times and disposed of safely once you leave our premises</li>
				<li>Our team members will wear appropriate PPE. In addition to a face mask, team members will also wear a disposable apron for every guest. A face visor and gloves will also be used</li>
				<li>Protective screens will be installed at reception and in between workstations (if needed)</li>
				<li>Limited number of guests in the salon. To maintain social distancing in the salon we are limiting the number of guests in the salon at the same time</li>
				<li>There will be no waiting area in the salon. Please take care when entering the salon as there will be no waiting area, and we ask that you observe social distancing rules</li>
				<li>We will not be able to provide refreshments at this time. We kindly ask that you refrain from eating or drinking in the salon</li>
				<li>Use contactless payment where possible. Wherever possible we ask that you pay by credit card or use contactless payment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Is it safe to visit a salon now?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Following government guidelines, we believe it is safe to visit a salon again from 1st March. We have put in place the necessary safety precautions to help protect you and our teams. Read our ‘Commitment to keeping you safe’ for full details on our salon safety provisions. We also feel there is responsibility at a personal level for maintaining sanitation and hygiene levels to reduce the risk of infection. We advise that you follow expert guidelines; if you believe you have symptoms related to coronavirus please self-isolate for 14 days and seek medical advice.
